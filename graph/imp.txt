BFS and DFS for disconnected graphs. 

BFS :  
minimum time required so that all the oranges become rotten. http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-time-required-so-that-all-oranges-become-rotten/

total X-shapes. http://practice.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/x-total-shapes/0 (can be done through DFS also) 
Similar to X-shapes : Count Islands. 

Union Find/ Disjoint Set 

Detect Cycle in a Directed Graph : Use DFS 
Detect Cycle in an Undirected Graph : DFS/ Union find 

Topological Sort. Difference between topological sort and dfs. 
Topoplogical Sort : Use a stack to store the explored elements. if an element is explored, push it into the stack. 

Head to tail ordering : A head to tail ordering of strings is the one in which the last letter of the previous word is the same as the first letter of the following word.
