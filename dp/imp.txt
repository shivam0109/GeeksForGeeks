In DP, i-1.j-1 i,j-1, i-1,j are of utmost importance. For subset sum problems, use i,j-m and so on. 

Edit Distance : if str1[i] == str2[j] -> i+1,j+1 -> mat[i-1][j-1]. REMEMBER start computation with empty string.

Given three integers x,y and z you need to find the sum of all the numbers formed by 
having 4 atmost x times , having 5 atmost y times and having 6 atmost z times as a digit.

Given an array of integers where each element represents the max number of steps that can be made forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array (starting from the first element). If an element is 0, then cannot move through that element.

Partition Problems
Number of ways to partition a set into k subsets. f(n,k) = f(n-1,k-1) + kf(n-1,k). First term comes from the fact that the new number stays single. The second term comes when the new number is sent to any of the k partitions.

Print All Subsets using DFS. 

Combination Sum 4: Find the number of permutations(different order is treated as diff ans) to make a given target. No need for backtracking as only number is required. 

Dungeon Princess : Given a matrix of integers, find the min starting health required by a person to reach the bottom right conrner from top left. We know the min health required at m-1,n-1. Use this fact to create a dp matrix from bottom right to top left. 

Cutting Rod : There is a rod of length N lying on x-axis with its left end at x = 0 and right end at x = N. Now, there are M weak points on this rod denoted by positive integer values(all less than N) A1, A2, â€¦, AM. You have to cut rod at all these weak points. You can perform these cuts in any order. After a cut, rod gets divided into two smaller sub-rods. Cost of making a cut is the length of the sub-rod in which you are making a cut. Minimize the cost. 

There are N coins (Assume N is even) in a line. Two players take turns to take a coin from one of the ends of the line until there are no more coins left. The player with the larger amount of money wins. Assume that you go first.
Write a program which computes the maximum amount of money you can win.
