2. Find min element in rotated array. (Keep in mind the boundary cases). 
3. Relative Sorting. Given two array A1[] and A2[], sort A1 in such a way that the relative order among the elements will be same as those in A2.

5. Efficiently sorting numbers in range from 0 to n^2 - 1 in linear time. 
6.  You are given N number of books. Every ith book has Pi number of pages.
